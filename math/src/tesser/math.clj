(deftransform digest
  "You've got a set of numeric inputs and want to know their quantiles
  distribution, histogram, etc. This fold takes numeric inputs and
  produces a statistical estimate of their distribution.

  `digest` takes a function that returns a `tesser.quantiles/Digest`. The fold
  returns an instance of that digest.

  For example, to compute an HDRHistogram over both positive and negative
  doubles (or longs, rationals, etc):

  Compute a digest using e.g.

      (def digest (->> (m/digest q/hdr-histogram)
                       (t/tesser [[1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 5]])))
      ; => #<DoubleHistogram ...>

  To specify options for the digest, just use partial or (fn [] ...)

      (m/digest (partial q/hdr-histogram {:significant-value-digits 4
                                          :highest-to-lowest-value-ratio 1e6}))

  DoubleHistogram, like many quantile estimators, only works over positive
  values. To cover positives and negatives together, use
  `tesser.quantiles/dual`:

      (m/digest #(q/dual q/hdr-histogram {:significant-value-digits 2}))

  Once you've computed a digest, you can find a particular quantile using
  `tesser.quantiles/quantile`

      (q/quantile digest 0)   ; => 1.0
      (q/quantile digest 0.5) ; => 1.0
      (q/quantile digest 4/5) ; => 2.0009765625
      (q/quantile digest 1)   ; => 3.0009765625

  The total number of points in the sample:

      (q/point-count digest) ; => 5

  Minima and maxima:

      (q/min digest) ; => 1.0
      (q/max digest) ; => 3.0009765625

  Or find the distribution of values less than or equal to each point, with
  resolution given by the internal granularity of the digest:

      (q/distribution digest)
      ; => ([1.0 3] [2.0009765625 1] [3.0009765625 1])

      (q/cumulative-distribution digest)
      ; => ([1.0 3] [2.0009765625 4] [3.0009765625 5])

  You don't have to return the whole digest; any of these derivative
  operations can be merged directly into the fold via
  `tesser.core/post-combine`.

      (->> (m/digest q/hdr-histogram)
           (t/post-combine #(q/quantile % 1/2))
           (t/tesser [[1 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]]))
      ; => 3.0009765625

  You may also use `tesser.cardinality/hll` for estimating the cardinality of a
  set. HLL+ uses a probabilistic data-structure to compute set cardinality using
  very little memory with accuracy tradeoffs.

  The HLL digest can be used like the above mentioned histograms:

      (def digest (->> (m/digest cardinality/hll)
                       (t/tesser [[1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 5]])))
      ; => #<HyperLogLogPlus...>

  Getting the cardinality out through a post-combine step:

      (->> (m/digest cardinality/hll)
           (t/post-combine #(q/point-count %))
           (t/tesser [[1 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]]))
      ; => 3

  I want to emphasize that depending on the size of your data, its
  distribution, and the number of digests you want to compute, you may need
  different digest algorithms and widely varying tuning parameters. Until we
  have a better grasp of the space/error tradeoffs here, I won't choose
  defaults for you."
