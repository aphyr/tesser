## A Motivating Example

You've got a big pile of data--say, JSON in files on disk, or TSVs in
Hadoop--and you'd like to reduce over that data: computing some statistics,
searching for special values, etc. You might want to find the median housing
price in each city given a collection of all sales, or find the total mass of
all main-sequence stars in a region of sky, or search for an anticorrelation
between vaccine use and the prevalence of a disease. These are all *folds*:
collapsing a collection of data into a smaller value.

In Clojure, we're used to writing programs like

```clj
(->> stars
     (filter main-sequence?)
     (map :mass)
     (reduce +))
```

But this reduction is *singlethreaded*, and can only run on a single machine.
You've got 48 cores in your desktop computer. Why aren't they all helping?

```clj
(require '[tesser.core :as t])
(->> stars
     (t/filter main-sequence)
     (t/map :mass)
     (t/fold +)
     (t/tesser (t/chunk 1024 stars)))
```

Tesser goes much deeper, but this is the essence: writing understandable,
composable, *fast* programs for exploring datasets.

## A Clojure Library for Concurrent & Commutative Folds

Tesser gives us a library for building up *folds*, and applying those folds to
a collection of *inputs*, divided into *chunks*. Chunks are reduced with
maximal parallelism, and the results of those reductions are reduced together.
We call the concurrent reduction `:reducer`, and the serial reduction
`:combiner`.

![Reduce/combine diagram](/img/reduce-combine.jpg)

In order to reduce over a chunk, we need an *initial value*. A
`:reducer-identity` function generates this initial value. Once the reduction
is complete, we may want to transform it using a `:post-reducer` function--for
instance, converting from a transient to a persistent data structure, or
discarding internal reducer state.

![Diagram of reducer identities and post-reduce](/img/reducer-identity-post.jpg)

Likewise, we need a `:combiner-identity` function to generate an initial value
for the combine reduction, and a final `:post-combine` function to transform
the combiner's output.

![Diagram of combiner identity and post-combine](/img/combiner-identity-post.jpg)

Tesser folds are *associative* and *commutative* monoids: they can be applied
concurrently and do not preserve order. We make this tradeoff to reduce the
need for coordination between reducers. Not all concurrent folds
require/provide commutativity: Algebird, for example, provides ordered
distributed folds, and clojure.core.reducers preserves order as well.  Right
now Tesser doesn't, but we might change that someday.

Unlike CRDTs, Tesser's folds do not require idempotence. In Tesser, 1 + 1 is 2,
not 1. Each input factors in to the reduced value exactly once--though the
order is up to Tesser.

## Representing a Fold

If all you need is a quick-n-dirty replacement for an existing `reduce` or
`fold`, just drop `tesser.simple` into your program.

```clj
(require '[tesser.simple :as s])
user=> (s/reduce + 0 (range 10000000))
  49999995000000
```

But Tesser is capable of *composing* folds together--combining simple functions
to express complex ideas. In Tesser, we represent a compiled fold as map of six
functions:

```clj
{:reducer-identity  (fn [] ...)
 :reducer           (fn [accumulator input] ...)
 :post-reducer      (fn [accumulator] ...)
 :combiner-identity (fn [] ...)
 :combiner          (fn [accumulator post-reducer-result])
 :post-combiner     (fn [accumulator] ...)}
```

For instance, here's a fold to find the sum of all inputs. While the reducer
and combiner often have the same accumulator type and identities,
this is not always the case.

```clj
(require '[tesser.core :as t])
(t/tesser [[1] [2 3]]
          (t/fold {:reducer-identity  (constantly 0)
                   :reducer           +
                   :post-reducer      identity
                   :combiner-identity (constantly 0)
                   :combiner          +
                   :post-combiner     identity}))
; => 6
```

Since `(+)` returns `0` (the additive identity), we can leave off the
identities; `t/fold` will use the reducer as the identity function. The same
goes for the post-reducer and post-combiner: `(+ x)` returns `x`, so we can
leave them off too:

```clj
(t/tesser [[1] [2 3]]
          (t/fold {:reducer  +
                   :combiner +}))
; => 6
```

Or simply pass a function to `t/fold`, which will be used for all 6 functions.

```clj
(t/tesser [[1] [2 3]] (t/fold +))
; => 6
```

But that's not all; we can transform the summing fold into one that operates on strings like "1" with the `map` function:

```clj
(->> (t/map read-string)
     (t/fold +)
     (t/tesser [["1" "2" "3"]]))
; => 6
```

Tesser provides a rich library of fold transforms, allowing you to build up
complex folds out of simple, modular parts.

## Core

[Tesser.core](http://aphyr.github.io/tesser/tesser.core.html) looks a lot like
the Clojure seq API, and many of its functions have similar names. Their
semantics differ, however: Tesser folds do not preserve the order of inputs,
and when executed, they run in *parallel*.

Applying a fold using `tesser.core/tesser` uses multiple threads proportional
to processor cores. Unlike reducers, we don't use the Java forkjoin pool, just
plain old threads; it avoid contention issues and improves performance on most
JDKs.

```clj
(require '[tesser.core :as t])

(t/tesser [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] (t/into [] (t/map str)))
=> ["4" "5" "6" "1" "2" "3"]

(->> (t/map inc)      ; Increment each number
     (t/filter odd?)  ; Take only odd numbers
     (t/take 5)       ; *which* five odd numbers are selected is arbitrary
     (t/mapcat range) ; Explode each odd number n into the numbers from 0 to n
     (t/frequencies)  ; Compute the frequency of appearances
     (t/tesser (partition 3 (range 100))))
=> {0 5, 7 2, 20 1, 27 1, 1 4, 24 1, 4 3, 15 2, 21 1, 13 2, 22 1, 6 2, 28 1, 25 1, 17 1, 3 3, 12 2, 2 4, 23 1, 19 1, 11 2, 9 2, 5 2, 14 2, 26 1, 16 2, 10 2, 18 1, 8 2}
```

Fold combinators like
[facet](http://aphyr.github.io/tesser/tesser.core.html#var-facet) and
[fuse](http://aphyr.github.io/tesser/tesser.core.html#var-fuse) allow multiple
reductions to be done in a single pass, possibly sharing expensive operations
like deserialization. This is a particularly effective way of working with a
set of data files on disk or in Hadoop.

Given JSON records about a codebase like

```clj
{"year":         2004,
 "lines-of-code" {"ruby": 100,
                  "c":    1693}}
```

We can find the range of years *and* the total lines of code in each language
in a single pass.

```clj
(->> (t/map #(json/parse-string % true))
     (t/fuse {:year-range (t/range (t/map :year))
              :total-code (->> (t/map :lines-of-code)
                               (t/facet)
                               (t/reduce + 0)})
     (t/tesser records))

=> {:year-range [1986 2014]
    :total-code {:c    153423,
                 :ruby 4578,
                 :tcl  3453
                 :bf   1}}
```

## Math

[Tesser.math](http://aphyr.github.io/tesser/tesser.math.html) provides
statistical folds. Some, like sum, mean, and correlation, are exact. Others,
like quantiles, are estimates.

For instance, to find a Pearson correlation matrix between ln(age), height, and
weight; and in the same pass, to find the total number of samples:

```clj
(require '[tesser.math :as m])
(->> (t/fuse {:count (t/count)
              :corrs (m/correlation-matrix {:log-age #(Math/ln (:age %))
                                            :height  :height
                                            :weight  :weight})})
     (t/tesser records))

=> {:count 7123525
    :corrs {[:log-age :weight] 0.74
            [:log-age :height] 0.86
            [:weight  :height] 0.91
            ... and the same keys in symmetric order ...}}
```

## Hadoop

The [tesser.hadoop API](http://aphyr.github.io/tesser/tesser.hadoop.html) takes
Tesser folds and distributes them using the
[Parkour](https://github.com/damballa/parkour) Hadoop library. You can test
your folds locally, then run them on a cluster to reduce over huge datasets.

```clj
(require '[tesser [core :as t]
                  [math :as m]
                  [hadoop :as h]])

(defn analyze
  "A fold that analyzes measurements of trees from a certain location."
  [location]
  (->> (t/map parse-record)
       (t/filter #(= location (:location %)))
       (t/fuse {:count (t/count)
                :oldest (->> (t/map :age)
                             (t/max))
                :corrs (m/correlation-matrix
                         {:age          :age
                          :log-mass     #(Math/log (:mass %))
                          :growth-rings :growth-rings
                          :humidity     :humdity})})))

(h/fold conf
        (text/dseq "hdfs:/some/file/part-*")
        "hdfs:/tmp/tesser"
        #'analyze "Redwood National Park")
```

See the [Hadoop demo
project](https://github.com/aphyr/tesser/tree/master/hadoop/demo) for an
example of how to run a fold in Hadoop.

## An integrative example

Here's a real-world example, drawn from a user profile verification suite:

```clj
(require '[tesser.core :as t]
          [tesser.math :as m]
          [tesser.quantiles :as q])

(defn fold
  "Computes aggregate statistics over profiles by country, income, age range,
  and gender."
  []
  (t/fuse
    {:total     (t/count)
     :country   (->> (t/map (comp :country :geo))
                     (t/frequencies)
                     (t/post-combine (partial into (sorted-map))))
     :income    (->> (t/map (comp :value :income))
                     (t/remove nil?)
                     (m/digest (partial q/dual q/hdr-histogram))
                     (t/post-combine q/distribution))
     :no-income (->> (t/remove (comp :value :income))
                     (t/count))
     :age-range (->> (t/map (comp :range :age :demographic))
                     (t/frequencies)
                     (t/post-combine (partial into (sorted-map))))
     :gender    (->> (t/map (fn [u]
                             (let [g (-> u :demographic :gender)
                                   m (-> g :male :confidence)
                                   f (-> g :female :confidence)]
                               (cond (not (or m f)) nil
                                     (not m)        :female
                                     (not f)        :male
                                     (<= -1/2 (- m f) 1/2) :rich-tapestry
                                     (<= m f)       :female
                                     :else          :male))))
                     (t/frequencies))}))
```

Here's another fold, from a namespace that analyzes behavioral segments (e.g.
commuters).  We're using the `metric-fold` function to do the same type of
numeric reduction (a range and a quantile digest) over two different fields:
`:percentile` and `:confidence`. Note that `metric-fold` takes an argument `f`:
the fold that it will transform.

```clj
(defn metric-fold
  "A fold which analyzes the range and quantile distribution of a number,
  returing a map of :range and :q-digest. Drops nils."
  [f]
  (->> f
       (t/remove nil?)
       (t/fuse {:q-digest (m/digest (partial q/dual q/hdr-histogram))
                :range    (t/range)})))

(defn fold
  "Analyzes behavioral segments. Emits nested maps where the first key is the
  segment name (:leisure_seeker), the second key is one of :percentile or
  :confidence, and the third key is one of :q-digest or :range."
  []
  (->> (t/map :behavioral)
       (t/map :segments)
       ; For each distinct segment...
       (t/facet)
       ; Could facet here, but fuse is a lil more efficient.
       (t/fuse
         {:percentile (->> (t/map :percentile) (metric-fold))
          :confidence (->> (t/map :confidence) (metric-fold))})))
```

Because the folds aren't bound to any particular datatype, we can combine them using `fuse` and transform their inputs using a parser--in a single pass.

```clj
(defn main-fold [opts]
  (->> (t/map (file/parser (:format opts)))
       (t/fuse {:behavioral-segments (behavioral-segments/fold)
                :demographics        (demographics/fold)})))
```

Because these folds are collection-indepedent, and defined in small chunks, we
can write small tests to verify each folds behavior indepedently, then compose
them into larger programs. We're free to name transformations at any level just
by binding them to `let` variables or `defn`s, or to build complex folds in a
single pass.

## Invariants

In order for Tesser to execute a fold concurrently, a fold must obey some
simple invariants.

- All functions should be deterministic functions purely of their inputs.
  Constructing two copies of the same fold on, say, different nodes in a
  cluster should result in equivalent behavior. You *cannot* squirrel away state
  in a lexical closure, for instance.
- Accumulators may be mutable, and folds never modify the same accumulator
  concurrently. You may mutate the accumulator in a reducer, combiner, or
  post-fn without synchronization.
- Reducers and combiners must be associative: `(f a (f b c))` = `(f (f a b)
  c)`.
- Reducers and combiners must be commutative: `(f a b)` = `(f b a)`.
- Reducers and combiners may emit `reduced` values, which force immediate
  completion of that particular reduce or combine. If a reducer emits a reduced
  value, it has no impact on the execution of other reducers, or the combiner.

## Performance

When the computation you're performing on each input dominates, Tesser should
be significantly faster than `clojure.core/reduce` and somewhat faster than
`clojure.core.reducers/fold`. Tesser performs worst when the reducing
operations are cheap compared to the cost of traversing the collection. Even in
these cases, Tesser's performance on laptop and server-class x64 hardware ain't
too shabby.

On a 48-way (including HT) E5-2697, summing 10 million random longs:

| Collection | Clojure reduce | Reducers fold | Tesser   |
|------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Array      | 460 MHz        | 420 MHz       | 2900 MHz |
| Vector     | 490 MHz        | 4300 MHz      | 4700 MHz |

And the equivalent of `(->> (map inc) (filter even?) (reduce +))` over those 10
million longs:

| Collection | Clojure reduce | Reducers fold | Tesser   |
|------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Array      | 43 MHz         | 270 MHz       | 2400 MHz |
| Vector     | 120 MHz        | 3400 MHz      | 3200 MHz |

Run `lein test :bench` to reproduce results on your hardware.

In general, Tesser...

- Sees the same benefits of stream fusion as reducers: fewer allocations for
  intermediate seqs,
- Can parallelize over primitive arrays (unlike reducers), and
- Reduces thread contention versus Java forkjoin (used by `reducers/fold`).

However, Tesser cannot automatically partition and traverse vectors as
efficiently as core.reducers can, which makes it slightly slower when you have
a single vector and ask Tesser to partition it for you. Passing a series of
vectors to `tesser.core/tesser` makes Tesser's traversal costs identical to
core.reducers.

There's also some low-hanging fruit in `fuse`, `take`, etc. that can be
optimized later; we allocate fresh vectors to box reduction state on every new
input, instead of clobbering a variable in place. Haven't gotten around to
tuning that yet.

In real-world applications, Tesser has significantly improved single-node
performance relative to `reducers/fold`, but YMMV.

## Vs Reducers and Transducers

Clojure's reducers and transducers embody sequential folds: they move from left
to right over a sequence. Reducers also includes a less-well-known
*hierarchical* fold which parallelizes a reduction via Java's fork-join pool,
but this reduction is still fundamentally ordered and local to a single
machine.

Tesser explores a different niche. It offers:

- *Commutativity.* Tesser folds must not depend on the order of inputs.
- *Concurrency.* Reductions over independent chunks require no coordination,
  making them good candidates for distributed contexts like Hadoop.
- *Stream fusion.* Like Reducers and Transducers, `map`, `filter`, etc. are all
  folded into a single reduction function. Intermediate values are
  stack-allocated, reducing GC load.
- *Collection independence.* Like Transducers, Tesser folds are abstract
  transformations and can be re-used against varying types of collections.
